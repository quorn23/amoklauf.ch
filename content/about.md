### Site

The site is to collect all sorts of info and scripts i come along.\
I'm currently a member of the Trash-Guides team and Notifiarr team.\
The information and scripts are mostly collected in the Discord Server, which is the best place to get support.\
Please create a support thread with all the needed infos, this site is just a collection, finding it here doesn't mean i can help you, or that i run the scripts etc myself.\
Some of the scripts you'll find i wrote for myself, as i like to play around with Proxmox, OpnSense and Pihole for example. Other scripts are written by the great people from the community mentioned.

### Build

Static HTML and CSS website powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a hardened theme called [hugo-WonderMod](https://github.com/Wonderfall/hugo-WonderMod). WonderMod is designed with strong CSP headers in mind. It features removal of inline JavaScript and using pure CSS. WonderMod is a fork of an original theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). Big thanks to my friend soup, it's still the best theme i came across.
